import numpy as np
import librosa as lb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC  # Example classifier, use any desired classifier

# 1. Data collection (Assuming you have a list of audio files)
# You might use a library like librosa to handle audio data.
audio_files = [...]  # List of paths to audio files

# 2. Data conversion to wav file (If necessary, convert to WAV format)
# This step may not be needed if your audio files are already in WAV format.

# 3. Normalize the data
# Normalize audio data using librosa or other signal processing libraries.
normalized_data = []
for file in audio_files:
    data, sr = librosa.load(file)
    normalized = librosa.util.normalize(data)
    normalized_data.append(normalized)

# 4. Extract time-domain features
# Extract time-domain features using librosa or other signal processing libraries.
time_features = []
for data in normalized_data:
    # Extract time-domain features (e.g., zero-crossing rate, rms, etc.)
    # Append features to the time_features list.

# 5. Extract frequency-domain features
# Use Fourier Transform to convert data to frequency domain and extract features.
frequency_features = []
for data in normalized_data:
    # Apply Fourier Transform and extract frequency-domain features
    # Append features to the frequency_features list.

# 6. Plot spectrograms and MFCC from some of the files and compare them
# Use matplotlib or other plotting libraries to visualize spectrograms and MFCC.
# This requires computing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and spectrograms.
# Compare and plot them to observe differences.

# 7. Implement the classifier (Choose a machine learning model)


# Prepare feature matrix
X = []  # Combine time and frequency features into X
y = [...]  # Labels for your data

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the classifier
classifier = SVC()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 8. Train the model (Already part of the previous step)

# 9. Calculate results and analyze them
# Use the trained model to predict on test data and analyze results
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)
# Perform evaluation, calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

# 10. Write report
# Summarize your findings, results, and analysis in a report format using markdown or a document editor.
